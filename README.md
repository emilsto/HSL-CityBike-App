## How to run

- Note: This project is still in development, so some things might not work as intended, and the instructions below might not be complete.

### Pre-requisites:

To run this project you need to have the following installed:

- Docker
- GoLang
- npm

### Running the app

- Clone the repo and cd into the root directory

#### Downloading the data

Download following files:

- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv
- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv

and place them in the `data` directory of the project. After that run the python script `parse_data.py` from data directory to parse the data into a format that the backend can use. 


#### Starting the database

- run command `cd db`
- run command `docker build -t hsl-bikeapp-db .`
- run command `docker run -d -p 5432:5432 hsl-bikeapp-db`
- The database should now be running on port 5432, you can check this by running `docker ps` and test the connection by telnetting to the port `telnet localhost 5432` , for example. You should see something like this:

```
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

- Good to go!

#### Starting the backend

- run command `cd backend`
- run command `go build`
- run command `go run .`

#### Starting the frontend

- run command `cd frontend`
- run command `npm install`
- run command `npm start`
- the app should now be running on port 3000

## Technical documentation

### General info

- The backend of the application is built using the Go programming language. It utilizes the Chi router for handling HTTP requests and the pq library for connecting to the PostgreSQL database. The database is running in a Docker container and it's populated with data from various CSV files through a python script. The script combines and cleans the data from the source files before inserting it into the database.

- The frontend of the application is built using React and TypeScript. It communicates with the backend to fetch and display the data from the PostgreSQL database. The user interface is built using React components, and the application is organized using a component-based architecture. TypeScript is used to provide type safety and better developer experience while writing the frontend code.
