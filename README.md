## How to run

- Note: This project is still in development, so some things might not work as intended, and the instructions below might not be complete.

### Pre-requisites:

To run this project you need to have the following installed:

- Docker
- GoLang
- npm

### Running the app

- Clone the repo and cd into the root directory

#### Downloading the data

Download following files:

- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv
- https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv

and place them in the `data` directory of the project. After that run the python script `data/parse_data.py` to parse the data into a format that the backend can use.


#### Starting the database

- run command `cd db`
- run command `docker build -t hsl-bikeapp-db .`
- run command `docker run -d -p 5432:5432 hsl-bikeapp-db`
- The database should now be running on port 5432, you can check this by running `docker ps` and test the connection by telnetting to the port `telnet localhost 5432` , for example. You should see something like this:

```
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

- Good to go!

#### Starting the backend

- run command `cd backend`
- run command `go build`
- run command `go run .`

#### Starting the frontend

- run command `cd frontend`
- run command `npm install`
- run command `npm start`
- the app should now be running on port 3000
